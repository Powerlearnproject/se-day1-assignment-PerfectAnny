#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans:-
Software Engineerig is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.It consists of software products design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
The importance of Software engineering in the technology industry is that it  enables creation of software application and system powers numerous aspects of modern life which includes communication, commerce etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):- This programming paradigm introduced the concept of breaking down a program into smaller, manageable modules or functions, promoting readability, maintainability, and reusability.
The introduction of structured programming led to the development of higher-level programming languages such as C, Pascal, and Ada, which supported structured constructs like loops, conditionals, and block structures. This milestone laid the foundation for modern software development practices by promoting discipline and organization in coding.

The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s):- The adoption of OOP led to the widespread use of languages like C++, Java, and Python. It facilitated the development of more modular, reusable, and scalable software, significantly improving software design and reducing the complexity of large systems.

The Rise of Agile and DevOps Methodologies (2000s-Present):-Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability while  DevOps is  a complementary approach that  focuses on integrating development and operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery pipeline. These methodologies have enabled organizations to respond quickly to changing requirements, improve product quality, and accelerate time-to-market. They have also fostered a culture of collaboration and innovation in software development teams.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans:-
The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle are 
Requirements:-  The phase has to do with the aspect of gathering and documenting the user's needs and system requirement.
Design: This phase deals with creating high-level and detailed designs of the software artichitecure and user intereface.
Implementation: This phase has to deo with writing of codes and building the software according to the design specification.
Testing:- This has to do with conducting of various test to ensure the software  meets the standard quality and the functional requirements. 
Deployment:- This phase has to do with the realse of the software to the user or customer.
Maintenace:- This final phase has to do with providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements of the software after deployments.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans:-
Waterfall Methodology
Sequential: Follows a linear, phased approach, with each phase completed before moving to the next (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment).
Plan-Driven: Requires extensive upfront planning and documentation.
Rigid: Less flexible to changes in requirements.
End-Product Focused: Deliverable is produced at the end of the project.
Suitable For: Projects with well-defined requirements, low risk, and stable environments.

Agile Methodology
Iterative: Breaks down the project into smaller cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and adaptation.
Customer-Centric: Emphasizes customer involvement and satisfaction.
Flexible: Adapts to changing requirements throughout the project.
Continuous Delivery: Delivers working software frequently.
Suitable For: Projects with uncertain requirements, dynamic environments, and a need for rapid delivery.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developers are primarily responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software.
Quality Assurance Engineers ensure that the software meets quality standards by testing and identifying defects.
Project Managers oversee the entire project, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and according to specifications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Ans:-

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ans: 
Some of the common facing software engineers are Rapid Pace of Technological Advancement and Data Management & Privacy
To over the challenges of rapid pace of technology advancement one has to engage in Continuous Learning and Adaptation.
To overcome the challenges of Data Management & Privacy, there is need to implement  Data Quality Management and Data Security Measures.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans:-
Unit Testing:- This focuses on individual units such as functions, methods, classes . It aims to verify that each unit works as expected in isolation. It detects bugs early, improves code readability, aids refactoring and supports continuous integration.

Integration Testing:- This focuses on the interaction between different software components or modules. It aims at ensuring that each components work together as expected . It also identifies defects in interfaces and data flow between components and the improves system stability.

System Testing:- This focuses on the entire system as a complete product. It aims to valuate the system against specified requirements. It ensure the system meets end-user-needs and then identifies performance issues, security vulnerabilities and usability problems.

Acceptance Testing:- This focuses on user perspective and satisfaction. It aims at ensuring that the system meets user expectation and requirements. It validates the system's readiness for production, builds user confidence, and reduces the risk of post-release defects.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Ans:- 
Prompt Engineering  is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.

Importance 
Accuracy and Relevance: Well-crafted prompts significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. A clear and specific prompt helps the model understand the desired output.
Control and Direction: Prompt engineering allows users to control the direction of the AI's response. By specifying the desired tone, style, or format, users can shape the output to meet their needs. Â  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans:-
Vague prompt:- Give a brief description on how to prepare african dishes. 
Improved Prompt: Give a brief description of the processes involved in preparing an african dish called MoiMoi
The improved prompt will enable the AI focus on providing  clear, specific and concise s methods of preparing a particular African Dish called MoiMoi.
